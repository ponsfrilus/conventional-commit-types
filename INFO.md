# About
I really like the idea of the whole [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
 or the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
 conventions but I wanted to modify prefixes and add better notes.

The real goal is to avoid that kind of messages: http://whatthecommit.com ðŸ˜‡

# About
I really like the idea of the whole [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
 or the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
 conventions but I wanted to modify prefixes and add better notes.

The real goal is to avoid that kind of messages: http://whatthecommit.com ðŸ˜‡


# Prefixes
I do like bracketed 3 letters capitalized prefixes. A good part of them are
adapted from the original
[conventional-commit-types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json)
repo:

```
* [ADD] â†’ ADD: When the project welcome new files

* [BLD] â†’ BUILD: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)

* [BTF] â†’ BEAUTIFULLAGE: (aka style) Changes that do not affect the meaning of
  the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

* [C.I] â†’ CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION: Changes to the CI configuration files and
  scripts

* [DOC] â†’ DOCUMENTATION: Documentation only changes

* [FIX] â†’ FIXE: A bug fix

* [FT.] â†’ FEATURE: A new feature

* [HOC] â†’ HOUSE CLEANING: Changes that make the repository more clean (wiping,
  cleaning, mopping)

* [IGN] â†’ IGNORE: When adding a .gitignore file

* [OTH] â†’ OTHER: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

* [PRF] â†’ PERFORMANCE: A code change that improves performance

* [RFA] â†’ REFACTOR: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

* [RVT] â†’ REVERT: Reverts a previous commit

* [STY] â†’ STYLE: Changes that mainly change the style, look and feel or visual
  appearance

* [TST] â†’ TEST: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

* [TYP] â†’ TYPO: An error (as of spelling) in typed or typeset material

* [VER] â†’ VERSION: Bump version

* [WIP] â†’ WORK IN PROGRESS: e.g. in case of fire
```

Please note they are sorted by prefixes in alphabetical order.
